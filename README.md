# limebet App 
This is a [Docker][] setup for a web application based on Django.

- The [Django][] application is served by [Gunicorn][] (WSGI application).
- We use [NginX][] as reverse proxy and static files server. Static and media files are
  persistently stored in volumes.
- Multiple [Postgres][] databases can be used. Data are persistently stored in volumes.
- [Python][] dependencies are managed through [pipenv][], with `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.
- Support for multiple environment settings (variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is passed
  to the `djangoapp` service).
- Tests are run using [tox][], [pytest][], and other tools such as [safety][], [bandit][], [isort][] and [prospector][].
- Continuous Integration is configured for [GitLab][] with `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
  CI follows a Build-Test-Release flow. **WARNING**: this part is not fully functional yet.

Also a [Makefile][] is available for convenience. You might need to use `sudo make`
instead of just `make` because `docker` and `docker-compose` commands often needs
admin privilege.

## Requirements
You need to install [Docker][] and [Docker-Compose][].

## Build
`docker-compose build` or `make build`.

## Migrate databases
`docker-compose run --rm djangoapp limebet/manage.py migrate` or `make migrate`.

## Collect static files
`docker-compose run --rm djangoapp limebet/manage.py collectstatic --no-input'` or `make collectstatic`.

## Run
`docker-compose up` or `make run`.

## Tests
- `make checksafety`
- `make checkstyle`
- `make test`
- `make coverage`
